# Haxl trial

This is a trial project for the [haxl](https://github.com/facebook/haxl) library.

I attempts to use as much of the functionality provided by the library as possible.


## Installing

This project uses [stack](https://stackage.org) for dependency management. Simply clone the repository and run `stack install`.
